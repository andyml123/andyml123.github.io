<div class="poems">
  <p><strong>Hang In There</strong></p>
  
<p>Hello, my friend; You're on my mind,<br>
Because you're somehow ailing,<br>
But your response to any challenge<br>
Has always been unfailing.</p>
  
<p>So I'm confident you'll win again;<br>
Hang in there, and you'll see;<br>
You'll be back on top in no time,<br>
  Tackling life courageously.</p>

<p><i>By Joanna Fuchs</i></p>
