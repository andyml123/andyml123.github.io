<h2>Get Well Poems</h2>

<div class="poems">

<p><strong>Get Well Soon</strong></p>

<p>I hope you're feeling better;<br>
I miss you every day.<br>
I'm always thinking of you,<br>
So this is what I say:<br></p>
<p>
Get Well Soon!</p>

<div class="poems">

<p><strong>Magic Wand</strong></p>

<p>I wish I had a magic wand<br>
To make it go away;<br>
I'd wave my scepter over you<br>
Until you were okay.</p>

<p>I'd think good thoughts; I'd send you love;<br>
I'd transmit healing vibes;<br>
My wand and I would surely beat<br>
Whatever the doc prescribes.</p>

<p>But there is no magic scepter, so
I cannot cast a spell;<br>
Just know you're often in my thoughts,<br>
And I hope you'll soon be well!</p>

<i>By Joanna Fuchs</i>

</div>

<div class="poems">

<p>If knowing that someone really cares <br>
Helps healing along its way <br>
Then I hope you now feel better <br>
And keep improving, day by day </p>

<p><strong>Bad Bug</strong></p>

<p>Has a bad bug gotten hold of you,<br>
Making you feel queasy?<br>
You're energy's low, you're indisposed,<br>
Being sick's not easy!</p>

<p>Just take this opportunity<br>
To recuperate and rest,<br>
And then when you return to us<br>
You'll be your very best!</p>

<p><strong>My Ailing Friend</strong></p>

<p>Get well, get well, my ailing friend,<br>
Whatever it is you've got;<br>
I'm sad and blue, thinking of you,<br>
And missing you a lot!</p>

<p>Rest in your bed, although you're bored;<br>
Be sure to sleep more than eight;<br>
Get healed, get cured; come back to the world,<br>
Where all your fans await!</p>

<p><strong>You Are Deeply Missed</strong></p>

<p>Get well real fast, my friend,<br>
That's what I wish for you,<br>
For while you're sick you're deeply missed,<br>
So I am sad and blue.</p>

<p>So have some pity on me,<br>
Don't leave me in the dump.<br>
Return to health real soon, my friend,<br>
Or I will be a grump!</p>

<p><strong>Bring Back Your Special Spark</strong></p>

<p>I hear you're feeling not so well;<br>
It's no fun being sickly.<br>
Please know I care about you,<br>
And hope you get well quickly.</p>

<p>When you're gone, you're sorely missed;<br>
A bit of my world turns dark.<br>
So take good care, recuperate,<br>
And bring back your special spark!</p>

<p><strong>The Flu</strong></p>

<p>You have the flu.<br>
You’re breathing glue<br>
And feeling kind of hot.<br>
Your fever’s high<br>
And though you try<br>
Your nose stays full of snot.<br>
So drink some tea<br>
And think of me.<br>
As far as I can tell,<br>
You’ll get no hug<br>
Or see my mug<br>
Until you’re feeling well.<br>
Get well soon!</p>

<div class="poems">
  
<p><strong>In Bed All Day</strong></p>

<p>You get to stay in bed all day.<br>
You get to watch TV<br>
Or lay around or read a book.<br>
Your time is really free.</p>

<p>Forget your work, your empty desk<br>
With files stacked to the ceiling<br>
And loads of e-mails to be read.<br>
We know how you are feeling.</p>

<p>Just settle back and rest a while.<br>
We promise you no flack.<br>
But when your rest is over, well,<br>
We really need you back!</p>

<div class="poems">

<p>From being with you all day long<br>
To getting you your favorite movies<br>
From calling you every single night<br>
To sharing some of our best memories<br>
Anything I can do to make you feel better<br>
Just ask, please don’t hesitate<br>
No favor is too small or too big<br>
After all, I am your best mate</p>

<p>Get well soon</p>

<p>I am sorry to hear<br>
That you’re unwell my dear<br>
So take your time and get your rest<br>
In no time you’ll be back at your best<br>
Sleep and relax until you are well<br>
Soon we’ll be back at it
Giving life hell</p>
