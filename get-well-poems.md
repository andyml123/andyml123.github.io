<h2>Get Well Poems</h2>

<p><strong>Get Well Soon</strong></p>

<p>I hope you're feeling better;<br>
I miss you every day.<br>

So this is what I say:<br></p>
<p>
Get Well Soon!</p>

<div class="poems">

<p><strong>Magic Wand</strong></p>

<p>I wish I had a magic wand
To make it go away;
I'd wave my scepter over you
Until you were okay.</p>

<p>I'd think good thoughts; I'd send you love;
I'd transmit healing vibes;
My wand and I would surely beat
Whatever the doc prescribes.</p>

<p>But there is no magic scepter, so
I cannot cast a spell;
Just know you're often in my thoughts,
And I hope you'll soon be well!</p>

<div class="poems">

<p>If knowing that someone really cares <br>
Helps healing along its way <br>
Then I hope you now feel better <br>
And keep improving, day by day </p>

<p><strong>Bad Bug</strong></p>

<p>Has a bad bug gotten hold of you,
Making you feel queasy?
You're energy's low, you're indisposed,
Being sick's not easy!</p>

<p>Just take this opportunity
To recuperate and rest,
And then when you return to us
You'll be your very best!</p>

<div class="poems">
  
<p>This little card is sent to say...
I hope you feel better day by day
So pop those pills and swig that tonic
and I am sure you soon will be supersonic</p>

<p><strong>My Ailing Friend</strong></p>

<p>Get well, get well, my ailing friend,
Whatever it is you've got;
I'm sad and blue, thinking of you,
And missing you a lot!</p>

<p>Rest in your bed, although you're bored;
Be sure to sleep more than eight;
Get healed, get cured; come back to the world,
Where all your fans await!</p>

<div class="poems">
  
<p><strong>You Are Deeply Missed</strong></p>

<p>Get well real fast, my friend,
That's what I wish for you,
For while you're sick you're deeply missed,
So I am sad and blue.</p>

<p>So have some pity on me,
Don't leave me in the dump.
Return to health real soon, my friend,
Or I will be a grump!</p>

<div class="poems">
  
<p><strong>Bring Back Your Special Spark</strong></p>

<p>I hear you're feeling not so well;
It's no fun being sickly.
Please know I care about you,
And hope you get well quickly.</p>

<p>When you're gone, you're sorely missed;
A bit of my world turns dark.
So take good care, recuperate,
And bring back your special spark!</p>

<p><strong>The Flu</strong></p>

<p>You have the flu.
You’re breathing glue
And feeling kind of hot.
Your fever’s high
And though you try
Your nose stays full of snot.
So drink some tea
And think of me.
As far as I can tell,
You’ll get no hug
Or see my mug
Until you’re feeling well.
Get well soon!</p>

<div class="poems">
  
<strong>In Bed All Day</strong>

<p>You get to stay in bed all day.
You get to watch TV
Or lay around or read a book.
Your time is really free.</p>

<p>Forget your work, your empty desk
With files stacked to the ceiling
And loads of e-mails to be read.
We know how you are feeling.</p>

<p>Just settle back and rest a while.
We promise you no flack.
But when your rest is over, well,
We really need you back!</p>

<div class="poems">

<p>From being with you all day long
To getting you your favorite movies
From calling you every single night
To sharing some of our best memories
Anything I can do to make you feel better
Just ask, please don’t hesitate
No favor is too small or too big
After all, I am your best mate</p>

<p>Get well soon</p>

</div>

<div class="poems">
  
<p>I am sorry to hear
That you’re unwell my dear
So take your time and get your rest
In no time you’ll be back at your best
Sleep and relax until you are well
Soon we’ll be back at it
Giving life hell</p>
