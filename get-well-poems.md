<div class="poems">
  <p><strong>I Care</strong></p>

<p>I'm sending this to let you know
I think of you each day,
And pray for your recovery,
Hoping soon you'll be okay.</p>

<p>You're going through a lot right now;
You're treatments can be trying;
Remember while you do them
It's your problem you're defying.</p>

<p>Hold on to your positive attitude,
And when things get hard to bear,
Know that I am here for you;
Remember that I care.</p>

<p>And when you're well and flourishing,
Look back and realize,
You learned what you were made of;
That's a reward that satisfies!<p>

<p>I believe in you; You can do it!</p>
