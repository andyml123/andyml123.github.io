Magic Wand

I wish I had a magic wand
To make it go away;
I'd wave my scepter over you
Until you were okay.

I'd think good thoughts; I'd send you love;
I'd transmit healing vibes;
My wand and I would surely beat
Whatever the doc prescribes.

But there is no magic scepter, so
I cannot cast a spell;
Just know you're often in my thoughts,
And I hope you'll soon be well!

Bad Bug

Has a bad bug gotten hold of you,
Making you feel queasy?
You're energy's low, you're indisposed,
Being sick's not easy!

Just take this opportunity
To recuperate and rest,
And then when you return to us
You'll be your very best!

Behind You

Soon, all this will be behind you.
At first, you'll look back briefly,
truly understanding what a gift health is,
how amazing it feels to be back to "normal."
Then you'll forget...
and resume skipping through a life
filled with a kaleidoscope of blessings.

Get well soon!
