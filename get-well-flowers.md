Sending get well flowers when someone is ill or injured is the most common way to show you're thinking of them. Flowers are beautiful and can help to improve the mood of the recipient. They're bright and fresh, making any room they're in seem a more alive and vibrant. They also often lift the spirits of whoever receives them.
