Our pets are more than just animals. They become part of the family. They're just as important as our other loved ones. So a pet that gets injured or becomes ill is an upsetting time for their owners. If you know someone who's pet is ill then you might be thinking of sending them a get well card. 

Get well cards for pets are a great way to acknowledge the illness or injury they have and provide some support and comfort to the owner. As a pet can often be overlooked in these circumstances the owner will appreciate you reaching out to them. 

If you aren't sure what to write in a pet get well card then take a look at the examples below. You can either use them as inspiration for writing your own message or copy them directly to your card.

<h2>What Not to Write in a Pet Get Well Card</h2>

There are a few things you will want to avoid saying in your message as it could cause offence or just be very inappropriate.

<ul>
<li><strong>He/she lived a long life</strong> - whilst this may be true in terms of the average lift expectancy of that animal, but when is any time long enough? You wouldn't say that to someone about their wife/husband/dad/mom etc. if they were ill, even if they'd lived to 100! You always want more time and whilst a pet having lived a long and good life is welcomed, them being ill isn't the time to bring that up.</li>
<li><strong>You can always replace them</strong> - saying that a beloved pet could be replaced with just a click of the fingers is deeply insulting. Pets are incredibly special and the bond that is formed with their owners is as strong as with members of their family. So suggesting they could just go and get another one would be extremely offensive.</li>
<li><strong>Are you going to put him/her down?</strong> - in fact any talk of putting them down or to sleep is very inappropriate. An owner will cling on to any hope they're beloved pet will recover. Avoid mentioning anything like this.</li>
<li><strong>Don't compare their illness with your pets</strong> - you may feel like your helping or empathising but unless it could be beneficial in the treatment of their sick pet then it's best avoid any comparisons. It can seem like your trying to take attention away from their situation.</li>
<li><strong>Nothing</strong> - don't be silent. It doesn't take much effort to reach out and offer some support. Even a few words saying you hope they recover or feel better is going to be appreciated.</li>
</ul>
