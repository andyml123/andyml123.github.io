<p>
Whilst a card and <a href="/get-well-flowers/">flowers</a> are a lovely gesture to give someone when they aren't feeling well, you might want to go a bit further and get them a gift. You might want to give a small gift alongside a bouquet of flowers that can help to lift their mood - receiving a sweet present from a friend whilst you're ill can really improve your mood.
</p>

<p>
Or you can get whoever is unwell a gift that can be of benefit to them whilst they recover. Something that is useful rather than just a throwaway toy or flowers that will last just a matter of days. Finding a gift that can provide real value whilst they focus on getting better could be hugely appreciated.
</p>

<p>
Whatever type of gift you choose to get someone, having some ideas and inspiration to help make that decision can only help. So take a look at the get well gift ideas below and hopefully be inspired to reach out and give a little something to a friend or loved one that needs cheering up.

</div>
<p>
A gift to comfort and encourage hope and healing. Willow Tree angels resonate with many cultures and ages of people. To some they represent protection, to some they are an outward reminder of inner peace, and to some they represent a way to remember those who have left this earth. Hand-carved figures reveal their expression through body gestures only - a tilt of the head, placement of the hands, a turn of the body. Enclosed inside each fitted packaging box is a gift-giving card with piece title and sentiment on it. Each piece is intended to be open to interpretation from the viewer. "Willow Tree isn't so much about the tangible piece. It represents an emotion or it marks a memory." -Susan Lordi
</p>
<ul>
<li>Sentiment: ”For those who give comfort with caring and tenderness” written on Enclosure Card</li>
<li>This figure communicates through gesture, to represent an emotion or mark a memory. Willow Tree sculptures express love, closeness, healing, courage, hope. Emotions of a life well lived</li>
<li>5” hand-painted resin figure with wire wings. Packaged in fitted box ready for gift-giving</li>
