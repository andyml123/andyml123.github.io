<h2>Funny Get Well Messages</h2>

<ul class="hearts">
<li>If I told you to “Get Well Soon,” it wouldn’t be soon enough. Get Well Now!</li>
<li>Please get well soon. I can only be nice to you for so long.</li>
<li>Laughter is the best medicine, or gin.. whatever</li>
<li>There are easier ways to get off work, you know. Glad you’re on the mend!</li>
<li>Remember to milk this while you can – 'cause you’ll be all better soon enough!</li>
<li>Try not to think of it as a hospital stay. Think of it as a spa package that includes meals, regular health evaluations and jello cubes.</li>
<li>Sorry your sick day is due to actual sickness.</li>
<li>Your stupid illness is robbing me of attention. Get well soon.</li>
<li>Germs, just like everyone else, find you irresistible. Get well soon!</li>
<li>Hoping for your complete recovery, because I can’t be bothered to come to the hospital for a second time!</li>
<li>Get well soon so we can make fun of you again and not feel bad</li>
<li>Being sick is just your body’s way of telling you you’re way too awesome, and you need to slow down so everyone else can catch up.</li>
<li>I may not be a doctor... but they do say that duct tape fixes everything!</li>
<li>I hope you feel better soon, so you can come back to work and immediately feel worse.</li>
<li>I heard pretendinitis really sucks. I hope you manage to get over it.</li>
<li>Studies indicate that those who receive get well cards have an 80% faster recovery rate.</li>
<li>Take all the time you need to recover. Your work will be here whenever you feel better. It will just be piled up extremely high on your desk.</li>
<li>If your immune system was a lawyer, I would fire it. It doesn’t seem to be defending you well enough.</li>
<li>Missing you in work, you owe us 10 drink rounds, 2 birthday messages, 3 collections and cakes.</li>
<li>Sorry you had to eat hospital food.</li>
<li>Get well soon, coffee rounds are more frequent when you’re off.</li>
<li>See? You’re so great, even germs like you.</li>
<li>I know you wanted some time off work but this was a bit extreme!</li>
<li>Folks who think laughter is the best medicine apparently have never had morphine.</li>
<li>Get well cards are great at keeping you from having to shake hands or hug a sick person. That's why you are getting a card from me.</li>
