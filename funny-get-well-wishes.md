<p>
When someone is ill or injured it can be a frustrating, miserable and often lonely place to be. They could do with being cheered up or having a laugh. That's why funny get well wishes can be so great. If a loved one or friend is unwell then you can send them a funny message or joke, maybe gently making fun of their situation. Putting a smile on their face when they're feeling down or fed up will be hugely appreciated and could brighten their boring or unhappy day.

<p>
However, you must be certain that the recipient of your message or card is going to be able to laugh at themselves and be part of the joke. There is a real chance they may not find being ill funny and could take offence. So be mindful of that and try to be 100% sure the person the message is intended for is the type who will be open to having their illness/injury poked fun at.

<h2>Rude/Offensive Get Well Messages</h2>

These funny messages are a lot more risque and in some cases downright rude! They will only be suitable for a small group of people with a certain sense of humour. So be extra careful when deciding on whether to use them.
