<h2>Get Well Prayers for a Friend</h2>


<div class="prayer">
Merciful God,

I offer prayers for my friend who is ill. Bless her with healing. Change her circumstances. Cause wholeness and wellness to come in abundance. I, who have a healthy spirit, pray that I may share the vibrancy of my soul, as I share my heart in prayer.  
Amen
</div>


<div class="prayer">
O Lord, my friend is so special,
They mean so much to me.
We've walked together for so long,
No closer could we be.

O Lord, please give them healing,
Restore them day by day.
Renew their hope and dry their tears,
Answer them when they pray.

O Lord, you are our Saviour,
Our strength when we are weak.
Your light is hope within our hearts,
When the day is bleak.

O Lord, I put my faith in you,
I trust you'll heal my friend.
May they know our love and care,
On us they can depend.
</div>










<strong>Get Well Prayer</strong>

Lord, hear our heartfelt prayer
for the healing of our Christian brother/sister.
We pray for your mercy,
Your compassion, Your grace and Your love,
in making him whole and well again.
Make the work of those treating and helping him
full of Your perfection,
and grant him a quick and complete recovery.
Lead and guide those around him
to provide what he needs: encouragement,
assistance and support.
Lord, we pray that you will
wrap Your loving arms around him,
giving him comfort, strength and peace,
drawing him ever closer to You,
as you lead him through this trying time.
In Jesus' name we pray; Amen.
