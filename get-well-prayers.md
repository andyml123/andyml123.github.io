<h2>Get Well Prayers for a Friend</h2>


<div class="prayers">
Merciful God,

I offer prayers for my friend who is ill. Bless her with healing. Change her circumstances. Cause wholeness and wellness to come in abundance. I, who have a healthy spirit, pray that I may share the vibrancy of my soul, as I share my heart in prayer.  
Amen
</div>


<div class="prayers">
O Lord, my friend is so special,
They mean so much to me.
We've walked together for so long,
No closer could we be.

O Lord, please give them healing,
Restore them day by day.
Renew their hope and dry their tears,
Answer them when they pray.

O Lord, you are our Saviour,
Our strength when we are weak.
Your light is hope within our hearts,
When the day is bleak.

O Lord, I put my faith in you,
I trust you'll heal my friend.
May they know our love and care,
On us they can depend.
</div>

<div class="prayers">
Think, o God, of our friend who is ill, whom we now commend to Your compassionate regard.

Comfort him upon his sickbed, and ease his suffering. We beg for deliverance, and submit
that no healing is too hard for the Lord, if it be His will.

We therefore pray that You bless our friend with Your loving care, renew his strength,
and heal what ails him in Your loving name.

Thank You, Lord.
</div>

<div class="prayers">
Dear God,

I pray that my dear friend will fully and completely, accept the divine idea of radiant health in body and mind. Not as hopeful thinking, but as reality that will continue for the rest of life. Regenerate. Reinvigorate. Renew.
Amen
</div>

<div class="prayers">
Dear God, 
As he lays in bed to rest, I pray my sick friend will be blessed. God, watch over him this night, bless him with Your love so bright. The angels they will dance and sing, and to him, sweet healing bring. When he wakes to greet the day, God I know you'll guide his way.
Amen
</div>

<strong>Get Well Prayer</strong>

Lord, hear our heartfelt prayer
for the healing of our Christian brother/sister.
We pray for your mercy,
Your compassion, Your grace and Your love,
in making him whole and well again.
Make the work of those treating and helping him
full of Your perfection,
and grant him a quick and complete recovery.
Lead and guide those around him
to provide what he needs: encouragement,
assistance and support.
Lord, we pray that you will
wrap Your loving arms around him,
giving him comfort, strength and peace,
drawing him ever closer to You,
as you lead him through this trying time.
In Jesus' name we pray; Amen.
