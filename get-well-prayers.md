<div class="prayers">
Lord, hear our heartfelt prayer
for the healing of our Christian brother/sister.
We pray for your mercy,
Your compassion, Your grace and Your love,
in making him whole and well again.
Make the work of those treating and helping him

May you have rest and peace in your heart.
May angels surround your bed through the night.
May each day bring healing with the dawn,
Restore your energy, and heal your wounds.

<h2>Get Well Prayers for a Friend</h2>


<div class="prayers">
Merciful God,

I offer prayers for my friend who is ill. Bless her with healing. Change her circumstances. Cause wholeness and wellness to come in abundance. I, who have a healthy spirit, pray that I may share the vibrancy of my soul, as I share my heart in prayer.  
Amen
</div>


<div class="prayers">
O Lord, my friend is so special,
They mean so much to me.
We've walked together for so long,
No closer could we be.

O Lord, please give them healing,
Restore them day by day.
Renew their hope and dry their tears,
Answer them when they pray.

O Lord, you are our Saviour,
Our strength when we are weak.
Your light is hope within our hearts,
When the day is bleak.

O Lord, I put my faith in you,
I trust you'll heal my friend.
May they know our love and care,
On us they can depend.
</div>

<div class="prayers">
Think, o God, of our friend who is ill, whom we now commend to Your compassionate regard.

Comfort him upon his sickbed, and ease his suffering. We beg for deliverance, and submit
that no healing is too hard for the Lord, if it be His will.

We therefore pray that You bless our friend with Your loving care, renew his strength,
and heal what ails him in Your loving name.

Thank You, Lord.
</div>

<div class="prayers">
Dear God,

I pray that my dear friend will fully and completely, accept the divine idea of radiant health in body and mind. Not as hopeful thinking, but as reality that will continue for the rest of life. Regenerate. Reinvigorate. Renew.
Amen
</div>

<div class="prayers">
Dear God, 
As he lays in bed to rest, I pray my sick friend will be blessed. God, watch over him this night, bless him with Your love so bright. The angels they will dance and sing, and to him, sweet healing bring. When he wakes to greet the day, God I know you'll guide his way.
Amen
</div>

<h2>Prayers for Healing and Comfort</h2>

<div class="prayers">
O Lord,
Only you know how hard life has been for me.
Only you have seen each moment of my day and night.
Only you feel my pain and understand my discomfort.
Only you are beside me through my grief and sorrow.
Only you have been within each moment to comfort me.
O Lord, break through the loneliness of my suffering.
You have encountered sorrow and laid a glorious path 
Of hope, healing and the promise of heaven in my heart.

Amen
</div>

<div class="prayers">
Jesus,
With just one touch from your Almighty creative hand,
You have healed the sick and raised the dead.
How amazing is your Lordship over all the earth,
How powerful is your redeeming love.
How great was your sacrifice to go before us and bring forgiveness and hope.
By your stripes I ask for healing.
Standing within your reign and rule I ask for restoration.
May life and wellness grow in fullness until it overflows. 

Amen
</div>

<div class="prayers">
Lord, 

Help me heal the sick today. Clear the way to recovery with the lightness of Your Presence. Guide my hands to give comfort when I cannot give hope, that I may give relief when I do not have a cure, and that I may radiate Your healing peace when the limits of science, time, and the human body overwhelm us all.
Amen
</div>

<div class="prayers">
Dear God, 

Dispel my fear. End my anxiety. Wipe worry from my mind. May the one I care about find good health and complete recovery. Make known the healing power of Your hands. Give comfort and shelter beneath Your wings. Grant restorative sleep tonight and safe passage to tomorrow.   
Amen
</div>

<h2>Get Well Soon Prayer for a Child</h2>

<div class="prayers">
O Lord,

Touch this precious one with your healing wings,
Come carry them, protect them though everything.
Tickle them with happiness,
Move their hearts to joy,
Surround them with goodness,
Teddies, books and toys.
Come wrap them in safety,
With hugs and love and care.
Stand by when they're sleeping,
Walk with them everywhere.
Restore his/her little body,
To leap and dance again.
Most of all Lord,
Be my little ones best friend. 

Amen
</div>
