<strong>Get Well Prayer</strong>

Lord, hear our heartfelt prayer
for the healing of our Christian brother/sister.
We pray for your mercy,
Your compassion, Your grace and Your love,
in making him whole and well again.
Make the work of those treating and helping him
full of Your perfection,
and grant him a quick and complete recovery.
Lead and guide those around him
to provide what he needs: encouragement,
assistance and support.
Lord, we pray that you will
wrap Your loving arms around him,
giving him comfort, strength and peace,
drawing him ever closer to You,
as you lead him through this trying time.
In Jesus' name we pray; Amen.
