<p>
When a friend or loved one is ill, has had surgery or is recovering from an injury the natural reaction is to want them to get well soon. You don't want to see someone you care about suffering or feeling poorly. So the way we try to cheer them up whilst they recover (aside from visiting them) is to send a get well soon message and gift. Something that can help lift their spirits and make them feel better as quickly as possible. 
  </p>
  <p>
Even a small gesture can go a long way when someone is feeling unwell. So use one of these 100 get well soon wishes to find the perfect words to let them know how much you're thinking of them. Touching or inspirational get well soon quotes and messages may be the boost that gives them a speedy recovery. So get your pen out and start writing!

<h2>What to Write in a Get Well Card</h2>

<p>
Writing an inspirational get well soon message may seem tricky but can be achieved without too much trouble. Your friends or loved one will appreciate you taking the time to wish them a speedy recovery. And kind, uplifting words can really help to improve the recovering persons mood and positivity.
</p>

<p>
We've put together this list of 100 get well wishes to help you get the best message and hopefully inspire you. However if you want to write your own, with your own words, you can follow some simple steps.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Choose your words carefully, being respectful and sensitive to how the sick person is feeling is essential.</li>
<li>Be positive. Don't focus on the negatives of their illness. Try to lift their mood and make them feel better.</li>
<li>If you feel it's appropriate then you can use a <a href="/get-well-jokes/">joke</a> or funny message. Be careful though and certain they won't take offence at this.</li>
<li>Mention you are thinking of them. For a sick friend or family member to know they are in the thoughts of the people closest to them is a real lift.</li>
<li>If you can - offer support. A message saying you're going to visit them, bring food, something like that. Even small chores they may need doing would be a huge help.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Not to Say</h3>

<ul>
<li>Unless you know the recipient is religious then avoid a message of that nature. Saying "you'll be in my prayers" is absolutely fine but don't go further than that. You could make them uncomfortable.</li>
<li>Try to be as normal with them as you were before. They won't want to feel like they need special treatment or treated differently to before being ill. Just be the same with them as you always are.</li>
<li>Don't dwell on the illness or be negative. Stay upbeat, lift their spirits and keep positive for them.</li>
</ul>
