<p>Writing get well wishes for a child can be tricky. It's fairly simple knowing how to say <a href="/get-well-wishes/">get well soon to an adult</a>. But it's different when you're talking to children. And most of the cards you can get don't have get well messages for kids in them. It's an overlooked area. </p>

<p>Which is a shame because children often get sick. They encounter lots of germs, spread them easily and are known to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2722603/">catch more colds than adults</a>. </p>

<p>That's without even mentioning other common problems kids get like earache, coughs etc. </p>

<p>So if you're struggling with how to say get better soon to a child then these get well soon quotes and messages should give you the perfect words for cheering a little one up while they get better.</p>
