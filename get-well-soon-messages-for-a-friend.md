<h2>Inspirational Messages for a Sick Friend</h2>

Sometimes friends need the people close to them to give them a lift. Being ill can take its toll and make you negative or unhappy. So sending or saying to a friend something inspirational to remind them they will recover soon and be back to normal eventually can be a big boost. So if you think your friend could do with their spirits lifting or have been feeling a bit down in the dumps then use one of these inspirational get well messages.  

<ul class="heart">
<li>I know you're feeling ill and probably a bit blue, but remember that everyone is wishing you well and sending you loving thoughts. Get well soon</li>
<li>You can beat this! Stay strong and you'll be well again in no time</li>
<li>Like all the obstacles you've faced you can overcome this one as well. Stay positive and you will be feeling better really soon</li>
<li>With time and rest this will pass. You just need to keep your head up and take strength from us - your friends</li>
<li>Your courage in facing this is inspiring. Know that we are all thinking of you so much and sending loving thoughts</li>
<li>Your spirit is strong and you have the resilient nature to take on anything. The friend I know won't let this illness beat them and I can't wait to see you fighting fit again</li>
<li>The way your dealing with your illness is such an inspiration to everyone. We're all wishing for a speedy recovery back to full health</li>
<li>Get well soon pal and take some comfort from knowing all your friends, including me of course, will be visiting soon</li>
<li>I love you so much and hope you know how much I care. Get well soon</li>
<li>It may seem tough now but you're going to get through this and come out the other side stronger</li>
<li>This won't last forever, I promise. Rely on your friends to help through it whilst it dies though. We'll be here for you no matter what</li>
<li>I can't wait to see you well again! It won't be long now and you'll be fighting fit</li>
</ul>

Taking the time to wish a friend the best and improved health is the least you should be doing when they're unwell. Try to make the effort to visit them, maybe bring a small gift or their favourite food, and be there if they need anything. And whichever way you choose to say get well remember that your friend will appreciate the effort and gesture behind it.
