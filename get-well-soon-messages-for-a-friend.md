  <div class="poem-title">Hang In There</div>

Hello, my friend; You're on my mind,
Because you're somehow ailing,
But your response to any challenge
Has always been unfailing.

So I'm confident you'll win again;
Hang in there, and you'll see;
You'll be back on top in no time,
Tackling life courageously.
