<li>Don't act or talk differently. They will want you to be as normal as possible with them. So write to them as you usually would</li>
<li>Don't be too religious in your message unless you know they will appreciate it. If you're in any doubt then err on the side of caution and stick with a regular message</li>
<li>Don't mention death! This should be obvious but all you will do is terrify and them. Avoid any mention of their mortality.</li>
<li>Don't use phrases like "everything happens for a reason" or "God has a plan". These sorts of sentiments can be offensive and not what someone who is ill will want to hear.</li>
